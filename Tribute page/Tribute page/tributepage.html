   <p class="col2"> The Bard of Avon, as William Shakespeare is also known, was the child of a leather merchant and glover, John Shakespeare. His mother was from a family of landed gentry. In the absence of records detailing Shakespeare's early education, historians guess he attended a nearby school where he learned to read and write English as well as Latin.

They lost their only son, Hamnet, when the boy was 11 years old. Daughters Susanna and Judith would live to be 66 and 77, respectively.</p>

During this period that historians refer to as the writer's lost years, only a scant legal document or two gives evidence of Shakespeare's existence. Over the years, various biographers have speculated that he may have been a poacher on the run from a disgruntled landowner, a horse-minder at a London theater, or more probably, a local schoolmaster. </p>

        <h3 class="lastcolumn-head1"> Shakespeare's Lost Years</h2> 

            <p class="endtext1"> We know very little about Shakespeare's life during two major spans of time, commonly referred to as the "lost years": 1578-82 and 1585-92. The first period covers the time after Shakespeare left grammar school, until his marriage to Anne Hathaway in November of 1582. The second period covers the seven years of Shakespeare's life in which he must have been perfecting his dramatic skills and collecting sources for the plots of his plays. he didn’t come from a very poor family nor a un-popular family. Shakespeare’s family were popular people, some were successful, and owned land, he himself was wealthy at one point, when his dad was making money “under the table”. The fact that he came from a pretty popular family portrays in his plays because in most cases the main characters are wealthy, successful, popular people. For example, Romeo and Juliet , both characters come from popular families. Duke Orsino and Olivia , are both important, wealthy characters with servants and nice houses.</p> 

            <h3 class="lastcolumn-head2">How Did Shakespeare Die?</h2> 

                <p class="endtext2"> The cause of Shakespeare's death is a mystery, but an entry in the diary of John Ward, the vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford (where Shakespeare is buried), tells us that "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and it seems drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted." Ward, a self-proclaimed Shakespeare fan, wrote his diary fifty years after Shakespeare died and most historians agree it appears to be a baseless anecdote. It should be noted though that a serious outbreak of typhus, known as the "new fever", in 1616 (the year Shakespeare died), lends credibility to Ward's story.</p>
